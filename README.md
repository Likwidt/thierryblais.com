My personal website
-------------------

Nothing fancy, just wanted to document and build a public source of my website and a few modules to put up for public display.  This contains installation instructions and a brief overview of the contents as well as direct links to modules.

### Requirements
Here are the few things you'll need that aren't included in the package.json or bower.json
- Node.js
- Bower

Aside from that you'll be required to run...

	npm install

...and...

	bower install

...and finally

	gulp

Now you should be looking at my site on chrome.
